CursorAI Prompt — “CourtMate” Tennis App

Objective:
Build a full-stack web app (desktop + mobile responsive + PWA) called CourtMate that connects recreational tennis players to schedule matches, track results, and monitor performance. The app must be production-ready, including backend, frontend, database, real-time chat, and basic UI wireframes.

User Registration & Profile

Register with email + password + phone verification (SMS).

Profile includes: first/last name, email, phone, optional photo, bio, play style, tennis rating (manual entry: UTR / USTA / custom), Home Court toggle.

Users without a home court cannot match with other users without a home court.

Courts

Users can manually add courts: name, address, coordinates, surfaces, public/private.

Validate court address with Google Maps Places API.

Admin approves courts.

Surface type determines color in the calendar (Hard=blue, Clay=red, Grass=green, Indoor=gray).

Match Creation & Calendar

Users create matches with multiple time slots for the same day.

Required fields: court, date(s), time slots, match format (singles/doubles).

Optional filters: skill level, gender, max distance, surface.

Calendar shows all matches matching user preferences with color-coded surfaces.
